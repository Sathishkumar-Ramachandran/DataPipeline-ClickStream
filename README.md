# DataPipeline-ClickStream
A real-time data pipeline that streams data from Kafka,processes the data in a data store, and indexes the processed data in Elasticsearch. 
The data pipeline will be used to ingest and analyze click stream data from a web application.


**Introduction:**
The goal of this project is to build a real-time data pipeline for ingesting and analyzing clickstream data from a web application. The pipeline is designed to stream data from Kafka, process the data in a data store, and index the processed data in Elasticsearch. This report provides an overview of the approach taken and the assumptions made during the implementation of the data pipeline.

**Approach:**

**Data Ingestion:**

Apache Kafka is used as the data ingestion tool.
A Kafka consumer module is implemented to read clickstream data from Kafka topics.
The consumer module connects to the Kafka cluster and continuously consumes incoming clickstream events.
The clickstream data is then passed to the data processing module for further handling.


**Data Storage:**

A data store module is implemented to store the ingested clickstream data.
PostgreSQL is used as the data store in this implementation, but it can be replaced with other databases depending on the requirements.
The data store module provides a class that handles the connection to the database and performs operations such as storing clickstream data.


**Data Processing:**

Apache Spark is utilized for data processing and aggregation.
A Spark processing module is implemented to process the stored clickstream data periodically.
The module reads the data from the data store, performs necessary aggregations (e.g., grouping by URL and country), and calculates metrics such as the number of clicks, unique users, and average time spent on each URL by users from each country.
Data Indexing:

Elasticsearch is employed for indexing and searching the processed data.
An Elasticsearch indexing module is implemented to index the processed data in Elasticsearch.
The module establishes a connection with the Elasticsearch cluster and indexes the data in an appropriate format, allowing for efficient search and retrieval.
Assumptions Made:

**Clickstream Data Format:**

It is assumed that the incoming clickstream data is in a structured format with key fields such as UserID, Timestamp, URL, Country, and City.
The data schema may need to be adjusted based on the actual clickstream data format used in the web application.
Third-Party Libraries:

Assumed the availability of third-party libraries for IP geolocation and user agent parsing to retrieve country, city, browser, OS, and device information from IP addresses and user agent strings.
The specific libraries used may vary depending on the chosen technologies and implementation preferences.
Database Configuration:

The assumption is made that the PostgreSQL database is properly configured and accessible.
The table schema and credentials are set up correctly to store the clickstream data.


**Conclusion:**

The implemented real-time data pipeline successfully ingests clickstream data from Kafka, stores it in a data store, processes the stored data using Apache Spark, and indexes the processed data in Elasticsearch. Assumptions were made regarding the data format, availability of third-party libraries, and proper database configuration. The pipeline can be further enhanced with additional features like error handling, scalability optimizations, and data quality checks based on specific project requirements.

Overall, this data pipeline provides a foundation for real-time clickstream analysis, enabling organizations to gain valuable insights from their web application's user behavior and make informed business decisions.



The Application especially designed for the Microservices Design, which can be later integrated with Flask APIs.
